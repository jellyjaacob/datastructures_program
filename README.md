# datastructures_program
Data structures in Java.

In this repository, these are the data structures that I learned in my CS310 Data Structures and Algorithms class that I took at SDSU with Patty Kraft.
I learned a lot and the application of the various key concepts in data structures in general, varying from arrays to linked lists to dictionaries.

The big thing to note about the repository is that we were assigned to implement the various data structures in our own way and understand the core fundamentals of how each structure works. We also had to check for all cases to ensure that the algorithm works as intended.
