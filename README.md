Data structures in Java.

In this repository, these are the data structures that I learned in my CS310 Data Structures and Algorithms class that I took at SDSU with Patty Kraft.
I learned a lot and the application of the various key concepts in data structures in general, varying from arrays to linked lists to dictionaries.
